# Checkmk

The Checkmk Module of Syncer overtakes Automation for Functions in Checkmk.
Based on your Hosts and their Attributes, you control how to sync your Hosts to Checkmk, and sort them in automatically created folders.

Furthermore, you can create [Contact-, Host-, Service Groups](groups_management.md) based on Attributes, all types of [rules](rules_management.md) or control the Bake and Sign of Agents or the Activate Changes from your Command line.

See the Recipes Section for more Step by Step docs.
