# YML

The Syncer can import data directly from YML files. Due to their structure, you need some configuration to do. Here is the file example:

```
all:
    vars:
      checkmk_server_url: "http://localhost:5000"
      checkmk_site: "local"

123-07:
    vars:
      label_key: "basisservice"
      label_value: "local_test1"
    host:
       test_host1:
       test_host2:
234-02:
    vars:
      label_key: "basisservice"
      label_value: "local_test2"
    host:
       test_host3:
       test_host4:
456-01:
    vars:
      label_key: "basisservice"
      label_value: "local_test3"
    host:
       test_host5:
       test_host6:
```

As you see, there are multiple sections where you have a list of hosts and variables.
These variables we want to add to every host of the following list.

This can be set in the account settings.
Here are the needed values to configure that example:

- **name_of_host_key**: `host`
- **name_of_variable_key**: `vars`
- **merge_keys_by_key_values**: `label_key`:`label_value'

With this config, the test_host1 would get 'basisservice':`local_test1` as well as test_host2.2
