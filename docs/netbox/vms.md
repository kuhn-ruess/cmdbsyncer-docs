# VMs

The Export of VMs is similar to the export of [Devices](devices.md).

To export Virtual Machines, Netbox has the requirement to set a Cluster.
You can create them before, and set the Clustername as a Field, but the Syncer has also the option to create clusters if needed.

In all Fields, you can use advanced Jinja Syntax.
