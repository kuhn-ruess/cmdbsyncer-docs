# I-Doit Sync
With the I-Doit Feature of the Syncer, you can Sync Informationen to I-Doit. That can be everything the Syncer knows about an Object, and could be everything. Everything means, you can use the inventory feature to import e.g. Checkmk Service Information, Checkmk HW/SW Inventory information, CSV or APIs. But thats True for every Syncer Module.

## How to Set it up

**Modules → i-doit →Custom Attributes**
In Rule Outcomes you can define the e.g. the Templates to send to I-Doit and use Jinja Magic to access the Attributes of the Objects.
