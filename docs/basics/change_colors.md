# Changing the Colors of the Interface

In bigger environments with tests instances, it's helpful to change the colors of the Syncer GUI to tell the environemnts apart.

That's possible in the [local_config.py](lcl_config.md). You can use the Variable `STYLE_NAV_BACKGROUND_COLOR` to set an HTML Color for the Background, `SYLE_NAV_LINK_COLOR` to change the Color of the Navigation Links and finally `HEADER_HINT` to add also a free Text to the Header. That could be the environment Name.
