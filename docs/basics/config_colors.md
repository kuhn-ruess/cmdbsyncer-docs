## How to Change Colors of the Admin Panel

To mark your test Instance of the Syncer, you can change the Background and Link colour, or even append an Additional Text to the header. This happens in the [local_config.py](lcl_config.md) which you need to create, if not existing.

There you can add the following Settings:

- STYLE_NAV_BACKGROUND_COLOR: "color or hexcolor"
- SYLE_NAV_LINK_COLOR: color or hexcolor"
- HEADER_HINT: "free string"
